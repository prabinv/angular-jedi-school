Angular Jedi School
===================

Hands on project for the angular jedi school presentation.

##v0

This is a simple static website built on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) using their starter template. You can run it either directly from the filesystem or by running a simple web server to serve the static files (***recommended***).

If you are on a Windows machine, a simple website to serve static files can be set up in IIS or using a static web server like [Fenix](http://fenixwebserver.com/) or by running the Python web server (SimpleHttpServer for 2.x or http.server for 3.x) if you have Python installed. On a Unix based system (MAC or Linux), you can run [nginx](http://nginx.com/) server or a Python http server.

###Your mission

***Add angular.js and demonstrate a simple data driven page.***

##v1

Steps:

1.	Download the [AngularJS â€” Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework](https://angularjs.org/) javascript file
2.	Add it to the list of scripts.
3.	Add the angular module.
4.	Define the controller on the module, and add $scope as a dependency.
5.	Define a property on the $scope, and bind to it in the HTML.

###Making HTTP calls

Angular provides the `$http` service, which can be used to make calls to HTTP endpoints. Add this as a dependency to the controller and mae the `get` call to the HTTP endpoint. This returns a promise, which like a callback, returns the data or the error from the HTTP call. Assign this to the scope and bind it to an HTML element.

###Templates

In Angular, templates are written with HTML that contains Angular-specific elements and attributes. Angular combines the template with information from the model and controller to render the dynamic view that a user sees in the browser.

###Services

Angular.js comes with a host of services for common tasks in JavaScript web applications, like $http, $log, $window and $document. It is a good idea to keep the controllers as thin as possible and use a service which encapsulates the business logic.

###Testing

One of the key advantages of using Angular.js is that it makes the code easy to test. Dependency Injection is built into the framework thus enabling easy mocking of dependencies when testing angular components. You can use any JavaScript Testing framework, some of the popular ones being Jasmine & Mocha. [Jasmine: Behavior-Driven JavaScript](http://jasmine.github.io/) is an all-in-one testing framework with the assertion and spying functionalities built in, while [Mocha - the fun, simple, flexible JavaScript test framework](http://mochajs.org/) allows you to pick and choose the assertion and spying libraries.

Angular.js also provides a mocks library which provides support to inject and mock Angular services into unit tests. This is especially useful when trying to mock out responses from `http` calls.
